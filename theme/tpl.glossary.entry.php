<h2 id="glossary_heading">Backcloth/backdrop</h2>
<p class="just">A large canvas cloth hung at the back of the stage from a grid.  The canvas is frequently painted and lights are projected onto the drop during performance. While common in Victorian theatres, it is more likely today to be found in opera and ballet productions.</p>

<h2 id="glossary_heading">Backing</h2>
<p class="just">A piece of cloth used to hide anything that may be seen through an opening in the set.</p>

<h2 id="glossary_heading">Back Stage</h2>
<p class="just">The area behind the performance space, including the wings, dressing rooms, workshops, which remains invisible from the auditorium.</p>

<h2 id="glossary_heading">Bag</h2>
<p class="just">A sand bag used as a counterweight for a suspended prop or piece of scenery.</p>

<h2 id="glossary_heading">Ballad Opera</h2>
<p class="just">Very popular eighteenth-century entertainment, or musical drama; spoken dialogue was interspersed with musical numbers which were usually set to popular tunes. Frequently satirical and political in tone, the most famous ballad opera was John Gay�s The Beggar�s Opera (1728) with music by Pepusch. The style was imitated by Bertolt Brecht in Threepenny Opera with music by Kurt Weill (1928).</p>

<h2 id="glossary_heading">Ballet Comedy</h2>
<p class="just">See Com�die-Ballet.</p>

<h2 id="glossary_heading">BAM</h2>
<p class="just">Brooklyn Academy of Arts. New York venue for large-scale and experimental theatre productions.</p>

<h2 id="glossary_heading">Bar</h2>
<p class="just">A metal rod used for hanging lamps or scenery. Each bar is numbered from front to back of stage. </p>

<h2 id="glossary_heading">Barker</h2>
<p class="just">These men, whose role was to attract an audience for a show, are associated with itinerant players and fairground companies. Their origin can be traced back to ancient theatre, but they became particularly prominent in the French Boulevard theatres of late 18th and 19th century. Possibly the best known barker in a twentieth-century production appears in the Stravinsky/Benois/Fokine ballet Petrouchka staged for Diaghilev�s  Ballets Russes in 1911.</p>

<h2 id="glossary_heading">Barn Doors</h2>
<p class="just">Four hinged metal flaps attached to a fresnel lamp whose purpose is to reduce part of a light beam.</p>

<h2 id="glossary_heading">Barre</h2>
<p class="just">A French ballet term, for the wooden bar, either attached to the walls of a studio (usually mirrored) or free standing if backstage, used for stage dancers to warm up before a musical or a drama performance requiring choreographed movement. In the case of ballet, dancers use the barre for two-thirds of their obligatory daily company class. It is used for balance and bodily adjustment and alignment (also stretching the muscles) while warming up the various muscle groups within the body with preparatory exercises. In the case of a modern dance production, it is most unlikely that a barre would be used for preparation and warm up, but for general stage dancing, including tap, one is always readily available.</p>

<h2 id="glossary_heading">Batten</h2>
<p class="just">This is a length of wood, numbered from front to back of stage, which might be used to fly scenery or simply to support a flat on which is hung a picture or weighty object as part of the scenery.</p>

<h2 id="glossary_heading">Bauprobe</h2>
<p class="just">Term used for a try out of a scene on a temporary set to see how everything works.</p>

<h2 id="glossary_heading">Bedroom Farce</h2>
<p class="just">Popular nineteenth- and twentieth-century form of comedy, originating in France, with Feydeau as its prime exponent. The term derives from its theme, which focuses on couples appearing to be engaged in extra-marital affairs. Thus, the setting is primarily a bedroom. The dramatic situation is frequently ridiculous with mistaken identity and revolving door exits and entrances. During the 1960s in England, this comic form was made popular by Brian Rix (see Whitehall Farce). Today, Alan Ayckbourn is the chief exponent of this style of comedy, including his play Bedroom Farce. </p>

<h2 id="glossary_heading">Beginners</h2>
<p class="just">This is a term called over the backstage speaker system five minutes before curtain up to bring all performers involved in the opening scene to the stage. The term, given by the ASM, is usually �Beginners on Stage Please� and a list of relevant characters may be added. </p>

<h2 id="glossary_heading">Below</h2>
<p class="just">Stage term meaning closest to the audience. For example: �Cross below the table� means walk in front of the table.</p>

<h2 id="glossary_heading">Benefit</h2>
<p class="just">A special performance in which all proceeds go for a specific person or charity. In the eighteenth and nineteenth century, the benefit was frequently for a member of the company, or a playwright, who would select the play, or plays, to be performed. The first such performance is believed to have been for Mrs. Elizabeth Barry in 1686. </p>

<h2 id="glossary_heading">Berliner Ensemble</h2>
<p class="just">A German theatre company founded in 1949 by Bertolt Brecht and his wife Helene Weigel to perform Brecht�s works. Until 1954, it was housed in the Deutches Theatre in East Berlin and then moved to the Theatre am Schiffbauerdamm.</p>
